Hi, I’m Jan👋

I'm a second year computer science major at the University of British Columbia, currently on a co-op term working as a Data Engineer Intern at BMO. 

I'm interested in basically everything to do with computer science, but my top interests are:
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Operating Systems
- Computer Graphics
