Hi, I'm Jan👋

I am a second-year student at The University of British Columbia majoring in Computer Science.

Previously, I've interned as a Data Engineer at the Bank of Montreal, where I helped develop SSIS packages (ELT pipeline automation).

Out of all the topics in Computer Science, I'm especially interested in data structures and algorithms, computer graphics, back-end development, and operating systems.
